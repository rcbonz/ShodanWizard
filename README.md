## Shodan

_"Shodan is a search engine that lets users search for various types of servers connected to the internet using a variety of filters. Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which are metadata that the server sends back to the client."_

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shodan_(website))

You can buy a Shodan [membership](https://account.shodan.io/billing/member) for $49 (one-time payment) and it'll give you:
```
Query credits (per month) 	100
Scan credits (per month) 	100
Monitored IPs			16
Available search filters 	All except vuln and tag
Number of users 		1
Shodan Search pages 		20
```
Every 100 query result consumes 1 query credit and that was considered when this code was writen: you can choose the result count before proceeding with the search.
